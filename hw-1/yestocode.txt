Experience with Web Architecture:
My previous job role as a systems engineer required me to develop web applications. I have been a part of end-to-end developments of web applications. I have worked majorly on developing the business logic and front end for the applications. I have written HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery before as a requirement for these projects. The projects were developed using java, spring framework. The back end used was postgreSQL and mySQL.

Favorite features from 2 browsers:

Features of Safari:

1. Quick Notes : We can highlight the site's text and click shift+cmd+y. This will copy the highlighted text and paste it into a Stickie note. This feature is important as it conviniently allows us to save the important information while we are surfing.

2. URL path navigation : We can view and navigate through the various levels of a nested site using Safari browser. From one of the nested pages we can right-click the title of the page and see exactly where we are on the site and from there we can navigate up if we want to.

3. Email Page Link : We can email the link to the current page we are on by just pressing Shift+cmd+i. It copies the link and pastes it into a new email.

Features of chrome:

1. We can keep our bookmarks, browser preferences, and browser theme synchronized on multiple computers, using our Google Account. 
We can access this feature by clicking on the Tools Menu on Top right corner and clicking on “Set up Sync”.

2.We can open a new tab inside Chrome browser and type "about:memory" (without quotes) –  we can see a list of browser processes that are currently running on our system and the amount of memory they are using.

3. Open Accidentally Closed Tabs : We have to press Control-Shift-T (Command-Shift-T on a Mac) and Chrome will reopen any recently closed tabs. We can keep hitting it for more closed tabs working our way back through our browsing history.
