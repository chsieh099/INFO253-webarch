HW #1: 
My experience with web architecture. Have you written HTML before? Written Javascript? etc.
    

I have zero experience with web architecture. I learnt basic html a while ago before but never put it to any use. I have no experience writing Javascript. I hope
the class gives me the knowledge and skills to understand basic web architecture and front end web development.


What are your favorite features from at least 2 browsers?

1. The search query autocomplete feature in Chrome and search without autocomplete in Firefox allows me to type my queries in the web address area after setting the default search
   engine. This saves me the time to enter search engine website's URL and allowing for the page to load before I actually type in my query.

2. I also like the Chrome feature of Search Google for on the right click after selecting a word/sentence on the webpage. This also saves time of 
   copying and pasting the word for my search

3. The extensions for Firefox and Chrome let you personalize your browsing habits by adding features such as adblock plus, Google docs etc.
